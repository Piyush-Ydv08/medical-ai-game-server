GUIDE: UNDERSTANDING HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE (HYPERTENSION)

1. What is High Blood Pressure?
Imagine your blood vessels are like garden hoses and your blood is the water flowing through them. Blood pressure is the force of the blood pushing against the walls of those hoses.
- Normal Pressure: The water flows smoothly, and the hose is relaxed.
- High Pressure: The water is blasting through with too much force. Over time, this damages the hose (your arteries) and strains the pump (your heart).

2. Why is this happening? (Causes)
High blood pressure usually develops over time. It is often called "The Silent Killer" because you might not feel sick, but damage is occurring.
Common reasons include:
- Diet: Eating too much salt (sodium) holds onto water in your body, increasing pressure.
- Lifestyle: Lack of physical activity or being overweight puts a strain on the heart.
- Genetics: Sometimes, it simply runs in families.
- Age: As we get older, our arteries naturally get stiffer.
- Stress: High stress levels can temporarily spike pressure; chronic stress keeps it high.

3. What Tests Should You Take? (Diagnosis)
- Sphygmomanometer Check (The Cuff): This is the standard arm-cuff test.
  * Normal: Below 120/80 mmHg.
  * High: Consistently above 130/80 mmHg.
- Blood Tests: To check your cholesterol levels and kidney function.
- Electrocardiogram (ECG/EKG): A quick test to see if the high pressure has enlarged or strained your heart muscle.

4. What Should You Do? (Lifestyle Changes)
- Cut the Salt: Aim for less than 2,300mg of sodium a day.
- Move More: Try brisk walking for 30 minutes, 5 days a week.
- Limit Alcohol & Quit Smoking.
- Manage Stress: Deep breathing, meditation, or sleeping enough.

5. When to Call a Doctor Immediately
If your blood pressure is very high (e.g., 180/120) and you have:
- Severe chest pain
- Severe headache with confusion or blurred vision
- Difficulty breathing

GUIDE: THE COMMON COLD VS. THE FLU (INFLUENZA)

1. What is it?
- The Cold: Usually mild. Uncomfortable and "stuffy," but you can often still function.
- The Flu: Usually severe. It hits you like a truck. Can make you feel so exhausted you cannot get out of bed.

2. Symptoms Comparison
- Onset: Cold starts gradually (tickle in throat). Flu hits suddenly (fine in morning, terrible by afternoon).
- Fever: Rare/mild in colds. Common and high (100F-102F+) in Flu.
- Aches: Slight in colds. Severe muscle/body aches in Flu.
- Energy: Tired with cold. Extreme exhaustion with Flu.

3. Treatment (Medicine)
Important: Antibiotics DO NOT work for colds or flu (they kill bacteria, not viruses).
- Fever/Pain: Paracetamol (Tylenol), Ibuprofen (Advil).
- Stuffy Nose: Decongestants (Sudafed) or Nasal Sprays.
- Runny Nose: Antihistamines (Benadryl).
- Dry Cough: Suppressant (Robitussin).
- Wet Cough: Expectorant (Mucinex).

GUIDE: LOWER BACK PAIN (LUMBAGO)

1. What is it?
Your lower back supports the weight of your upper body.
- Acute Pain: Sharp, lasts days to weeks (injury).
- Chronic Pain: Dull/aching, lasts longer than 3 months.

2. Causes
- Muscle Strain ("Pulled Back"): Lifting heavy, twisting, bad sleep position.
- "Desk Job" Effect: Sitting tightens hip muscles and weakens glutes.
- Herniated Disc: The cushion between bones cracks and presses on a nerve (Sciatica).

3. What to Do ("Motion is Lotion")
- Keep Moving: Bed rest is bad! Walking is excellent therapy.
- Ice vs Heat: Ice for first 48 hours (inflammation). Heat after 48 hours (relax muscles).
- Sleep: Sleep on your side with a pillow between knees.

4. Red Flags (Call Doctor Immediately)
- "Saddle Anesthesia": Numbness in groin/inner thigh.
- Bathroom Issues: Inability to control bladder/bowels.
- Foot Drop: Cannot lift your big toe/foot drags.
